# Automated Server Provisioning

### This command configures AWS CLI with a specific profile. Ensure you use the correct profile name and credentials.

aws configure --profile myprofile

### Initializes the Terraform working directory by downloading necessary modules and provider plugins.

terraform init

### You might want to remove the -auto-approve flag for critical environments to ensure oversight before applying changes.

terraform apply -auto-approve -var-file=vars.tfvars

### Installs required Ansible roles and collections listed in the requirements.yml file.

ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml

### This block configures an S3 bucket with server-side encryption enabled using AWS KMS for enhanced security.

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "secure_bucket"

### Defines an encrypted EBS volume using AWS KMS to secure data at rest.

resource "aws_ebs_volume" "secure_volume"

### Enables AWS GuardDuty to monitor for malicious activity and threats in your environment.

resource "aws_guardduty_detector" "main"

### Sets up an AWS Config rule to ensure all EBS volumes are encrypted, enforcing compliance.

resource "aws_config_config_rule" "encrypted_volumes"

### Runs Ansible linting to validate playbook syntax and best practices.

ansible-lint playbook.yml

### Initiates a security assessment using AWS Inspector. Replace '<template-arn>' with the appropriate ARN for your assessment template.

aws inspector start-assessment-run

## Usage and Prerequisites:

Prerequisites:

    Install Terraform (>= 1.3.0) and Ansible (>= 2.10).
    Configure AWS CLI with appropriate credentials:

    aws configure --profile myprofile

Steps for usage:

    Initialize Terraform:

terraform init
terraform plan -var-file=vars.tfvars
terraform apply -auto-approve -var-file=vars.tfvars

Run Ansible Playbooks: Install roles and configure servers:

ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml setup.yml

Verify Configuration: Test server and database connectivity:

    ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml test.yml

Monitoring and Alerts

    Use AWS CloudWatch for system metrics.
    Enable GuardDuty for threat detection.
    Use AWS Inspector for regular vulnerability scans:

    aws inspector start-assessment-run --assessment-template-arn <template-arn>

CI/CD Pipeline

Automate deployment using GitHub Actions:

    Run Terraform and Ansible linters.
    Deploy infrastructure and verify compliance.
    Integrate Slack or email notifications for build status.

Additional Automation:

    Secrets Management: Dynamic injection of secrets using HashiCorp Vault.
    Log Management: Retain logs for compliance and optimize costs with CloudWatch.
    OS Patch Management: Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager for automatic updates.

# Next Version Updates:

    Support for multi-cloud deployments.
    Integrate service meshes (e.g., Istio) for advanced traffic management.
    Add support for Kubernetes with EKS and Helm charts.
